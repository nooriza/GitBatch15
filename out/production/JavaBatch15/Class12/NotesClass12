OOP(OBject Oriented Programing)
It is just a way of writing code. That follow certain rules of guidelines. We Create classes that have
attributes/properties/fields and methods/function/behavioursim.

Why we should we learn OOP?
1)It simplifies tha software development and maintenance (adding new features changing the exi
2) Code duplication is reduced
3) It also helps us represent something from real life with the help of classes and
objects.

Class:
It is a blueprint or design from which actual real life object are created. Computer uses a class to check
what that class can do
for example

Object:
Object are created from classes and we an use them to call methods and the preporties from those classes.
An object has 1) - state(attributes/properties)   2) - Behavior(methods) 3) - Identity(unique name)
Method is the behavior of the object
