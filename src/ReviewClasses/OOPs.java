    //In summary, the class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances of that class).
    // It defines a set of attributes (instance variables) and behaviors (methods) that an object of that class can have.
    // An object is an instance of a class. You create an object by calling the constructor of the class,
    // which is a special method that sets up the initial state of the object. A method is a block of code that performs a specific task.
    // It can accept parameters,
    // return a result, or both. Clear cut and simple.
